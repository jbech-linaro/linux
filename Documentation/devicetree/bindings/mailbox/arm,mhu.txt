ARM Message Handling Unit(MHU)
------------------------------

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "arm,mhu"
- reg : exactly one register range with length 0x1000(4kB)
- interrupts : list of interrupt specifiers associated with the device
- interrupt-names : contains names of the interrupt in the order in which
		    they were specified in the interrupts property
- #mbox-cells : number of cells in a mailbox specifier, should be 1.
		The 'mboxes' specifier should be a linear index to the
		mailbox this device supports.

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/mailbox.txt
for more details about the generic mailbox controller and
client driver bindings.

Example:

mailbox: mhu@2b1f0000 {
	compatible = "arm,mhu";
	reg = <0x0 0x2b1f0000 0x0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 35 4>,
		     <0 36 4>;
	interrupt-names = "mhu_hpri_rx",
			  "mhu_lpri_rx";
	#mbox-cells = <1>;
};
